# Express-w-Auth0 üîê
### Description
Used Node.js, Express, Pug, and CSS to create a web application that renders a stylish user interface with dynamic data by communicating with an API.

### Authentication part
Also used Passport.js with Auth0 to manage user authentication and protect routes of a client that consumes an API. The client is server-side rendered using Pug templates styled with CSS.

### Connect to your tenant
Take a look at the .env.example in the source code. You need to set up a connection to your Auth0 Tenant. Check this [guide](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/express/01-login) out to set up Auth0 Tenant.
